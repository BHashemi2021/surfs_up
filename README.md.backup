# Surfs Up
 Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval.

## Overview of the analysis: 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Background
Upon a trip to Oahu, Hawaii, we fall in love with the place, decide to move there and open a surf shop. But in a meeting with W. Avy, a very successful surfer, we understand we need to be cognisant of the weather conditions if we plan to be successful in our business as other people had gone the same path and had to close their business for the lack of attention to weather conditions. So after the first meting, we create a weather analysis to share with him and ask his opinion.

W. Avy likes our analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### What We Are Creating
We have been tasked to create two technical analysis deliverables and a written report:

1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)


## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. 
Use images as support where needed.



## Summary: 
Provide a high-level summary of the results 
two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
