# Surfs Up
 Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval.

## Background
Upon a trip to Oahu, Hawaii, we like there and decide to move there and open a surf shop. But in a meeting with W. Avy, a very successful surfer, we understand we need to be cognisant of the weather conditions if we plan to be successful in our business as other people had gone the same path and had to close their business for the lack of attention to weather conditions. So after the first meting, we create a weather analysis to share with him and ask his opinion.

W. Avy likes our analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### What We Are Creating
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. We will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

#### Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.


#### Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December 

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.


#### Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis 


For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.

The analysis should contain the following:

## Overview of the analysis: 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.



## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


## Summary: 
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
